## Acknowledgments

The building of this theme was initiated with the [Theme Experiments repo](https://github.com/WordPress/theme-experiments), specifically the script which creates a [new blank theme](https://github.com/WordPress/theme-experiments#generating-your-own-starter-theme), and benefits from the examples themes therein, as well as the [Hansen theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/hansen/).

As with anything WordPress, the content of this repository is community-driven, the result of hard-work and generous sharing of the millions of builders of WordPress. Special thanks to the generosity of Carolina Newmark and her efforts on her [Full Site Editing site](https://fullsiteediting.com/).
